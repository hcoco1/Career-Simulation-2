### The principle of least privilege (PoLP)

**Managing administrative privileges for a new hire is a critical task that must be approached with careful consideration of both security and operational efficiency.**

Careful Allocation of Privileges: This may be necessary for joining a domain, setting up user accounts, and establishing network settings. It is essential to consider the administrative rights granted to newly hired personnel carefully. IT administrators typically handle such tasks for standard users to avoid granting excessive privileges.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Enforcing RBAC ensures that admin rights are assigned based on the new hire's roles and responsibilities. This approach grants only the necessary privileges, reducing the risk of security exposure.

Security Training and Awareness: New hires assuming administrative roles also undergo security training to understand the risks and responsibilities associated with these privileges. This includes learning about security policies, best practices for managing network settings, and the consequences of misuse.

Monitoring and Auditing: Activities carried out with administrative privileges must be monitored and audited regularly to ensure they are performed correctly and securely.
