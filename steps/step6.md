- Open the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC).

  On a client computer in the Sales OU, run `gpupdate` at the command prompt to force the policy update and verify that the script runs at user logon.
- Log in to a test user account that is part of the Sales OU.
- Before login, verify there is no mapped network drive.
